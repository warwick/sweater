#  Sweater â€“ Weather for the West Coast

A little "weekend project" weather app for iOS.  Because everyone should build a weather app at some point, and because I have zero intuition around needing a sweater.

Here's what this project is going to do:

- Show you the current weather for your current location
- Add additional other locations
- Recommend if you should bring along a sweater.

## Built With
- XCode 12.5
- Swift 5
- iOS 14.5 SDK

## APIs
- [The GraphQL Weather API](https://graphql-weather-api.herokuapp.com)

## Third Party Libraries
(None so far)
